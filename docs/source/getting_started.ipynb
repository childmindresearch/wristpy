    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### ⚠️ Important Note for macOS Users\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **wristpy** depends on `libomp`, a system-level dependency that is not always installed by default on macOS. Install it via:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ```bash\n",
    "> brew install libomp\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction \n",
    "The main processing pipeline of the wristpy module can be described as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data loading**: sensor data is loaded using [`actfast`](https://github.com/childmindresearch/actfast), and a `WatchData` object is created to store all sensor data.\n",
    "- **Data calibration**: A post-manufacturer calibration step can be applied, to ensure that the acceleration sensor is measuring 1*g* force during periods of no motion. There are three possible options: `None`, `gradient`, `ggir`.\n",
    "- ***Data imputation*** In the special case when dealing with the Actigraph `idle_sleep_mode == enabled`, the gaps in acceleration are filled in after calibration, to avoid biasing the calibration phase.\n",
    "- **Metrics Calculation**: Calculates various activity metrics on the calibrated data, namely ENMO (Euclidean norm, minus one), MAD (mean amplitude deviation) <sup>1</sup>, Actigraph activity counts<sup>2</sup>, MIMS (monitor-independent movement summary) unit <sup>3</sup>, and angle-Z (angle of acceleration relative to the *x-y* axis).\n",
    "- **Non-wear detection**: We find periods of non-wear based on the acceleration data. Specifically, the standard deviation of the acceleration values in a given time window, along each axis, is used as a threshold to decide `wear` or `not wear`. Additionally, we can use the temperature sensor, when avaialable, to augment the acceleration data. This is used in the CTA (combined temperature and acceleration) algorithm <sup>4</sup>, and in the `skdh` DETACH algorithm <sup>5</sup>. Furthermore, ensemble classification of non-wear periods is possible by providing a list (of any length) of non-wear algorithm options.\n",
    "- **Sleep Detection**: Using the HDCZ<sup>6</sup> and HSPT<sup>7</sup> algorithms to analyze changes in arm angle we are able to find periods of sleep. We find the sleep onset-wakeup times for all sleep windows detected. Any sleep periods that overlap with detected non-wear times are removed, and any remaining sleep periods shorter than 15 minutes (default value) are removed. Additionally, the SIB (sustained inactivity bouts) and the SPT (sleep period time) windows are provided as part of the output to aid in sleep metric post-processing.\n",
    "- **Physical activity levels**: Using the chosen physical activity metric (aggregated into time bins, 5 second default) we compute activity levels into the following categories: [`inactive`, `light`, `moderate`, `vigorous`]. The threshold values can be defined by the user, while the default values are chosen based on the specific activity metric and the values found in the literature  <sup>8-10</sup>.\n",
    "- **Data output**: The output results can be saved in `.csv` or `.parquet` data formats, with the run-time configuration parameters saved in a `.json` dictionary.\n",

    "## Python Tutorial \n",
    "\n",
    "Wristpy is a Python library designed for processing and analyzing wrist-worn accelerometer data.\n",
    "This tutorial will guide you through the basic steps of using `wristpy` to analyze your accelerometer data using python. Specifically,\n",
    "we will cover the following topics through a few examples:\n",
    "   - running the default processor, analyzing the output data, and visualizing the results.\n",
    "   - loading data and plotting the raw signals.\n",
    "   - how to calibrate the data, computing ENMO and angle-z from the calibrated data and then plotting those metrics.\n",
    "   - how to obtain non-wear windows and visualize them.\n",
    "   - how to obtain sleep windows and visualize them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1: Running the default processor\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Running files and directories\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The `orchestrator` module of wristpy contains the default processor that will run the entire wristpy processing pipeline. This can be called as simply as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from wristpy.core import orchestrator\n",
    "\n",
    "results = orchestrator.run(\n",
    "   input = '/path/to/your/file.gt3x',\n",
    "   output = 'path/to/save/file_name.csv'\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "This runs the processing pipeline with all the default arguments, creates an output `.csv` file, a `.json` file with the pipeline configuration parameters, and will create a `results` object that contains the various output metrics (namely; the specified physical activity metric, angle-z, physical activity classification values, non-wear status, and sleep status).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The orchestrator can also process entire directories. The call to the orchestrator remains largely the same but now output is expected to be a directory and the desired filetype for the saved files can be specified through the output_filetype arguement(default value is \".csv\"):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from wristpy.core import orchestrator\n",
    "\n",
    "results = orchestrator.run(\n",
    "    input = '/path/to/input/dir',\n",
    "    output = '/path/to/output/dir',\n",
    "    output_filetype = \".csv\"\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If users would prefer to process specific files instead of entire directories we recommend looping through a list of file names. The following code snipet will save results objects into a dictionary, and the output files into the desired directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from wristpy.core import orchestrator\n",
    "import pathlib\n",
    "\n",
    "file_path = pathlib.Path(\"/path/to/data/\")\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Physical Activity Metrics & Results\n",
    "\n",
    "Wristpy is capable of calculating the following physical activity metrics from actigraphy data:\n",
    "1. [Euclidean Norm Minus-One (ENMO)](https://childmindresearch.github.io/wristpy/getting_started.html#enmo-euclidean-norm-minus-one)\n",

    "4. [Monitor Independent Movement Summary Units (MIMS)](https://childmindresearch.github.io/wristpy/getting_started.html#mims-monitor-independent-summary-units)\n",
    "\n",
    "The default metric is ENMO, but you can pass any combination of supported metrics as a list to the orchestrator:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from wristpy.core import orchestrator\n",
    "\n",
    "results = orchestrator.run(\n",

    "\n",
    "The resulting [OrchestratorResults](https://childmindresearch.github.io/wristpy/api/wristpy.io.writers.writers.html#wristpy.io.writers.writers.OrchestratorResults) object will contain the outputs for each metric in the order they were provided.

    "MIMS is a standardized, device-agnostic summary unit. The pipeline interpolates to a fixed frequency (100 Hz), extrapolates values outside device range, band-pass filters, integrates area-under-the-curve per axis over each epoch, then combines axes (sum or vector magnitude) with small-value truncation. It’s designed to be comparable across devices and studies. This metric is computationally intensive and will run significantly slower than the other algorithms.\n",

    "## A Special Note on Idle Sleep Mode. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `idle_sleep_mode` for Actigraph watches will lead to uneven sampling rates during periods of no motion (read about this [here](https://actigraphcorp.my.site.com/support/s/article/Idle-Sleep-Mode-Explained)). Consequently, this causes issues when implementing wristpy's non-wear and sleep detection. As of this moment, we fill in the missing acceleration data with the assumption that the watch is perfectly idle in the face-up position (Acceleration vector = [0, 0, -1]). The data is filled in at the same sampling rate as the raw acceleration data. In the special circumstance when acceleration samples are not evenly spaced, the data is resampled to the highest effective sampling rate to ensure linearly sampled data."
