# MIMS Example Data Documentation

This document provides details on how the test data for the MIMS (Monitor Independent Movement Summary) metric and its subfunctions were generated.


## Data Generation Process

The MIMS algorithm consists of 5 main steps:
* Interpolation
* Extrapolation
* Bandpass Filter
* Aggregation
* Truncation

Each major step has associated test data that was used to validate the wristpy implementation. Test data was gathered using an actigraph device model: wGT3XBT which has a dynamic range of 
Â±8

### 1. Interpolation Test data

The interpolation test data was generated using the following R script and saved as 'actigraph_interpolation_r_version.csv' :

```r
library(MIMSunit)
raw_data <- read.gt3x("~/Github/wristpy/tests/sample_data/example_actigraph.gt3x")
accel_df <- as.data.frame(raw_data)
interpolate_df <- MIMSunit::interpolate_signal(df = accel_df, method = "spline_natural", sr = 100)
write.csv(interpolate_df, "actigraph_interpolation_r_version.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```
