# Security

Child Mind Institute values the security of our users, data, and servers. We take the security of our systems seriously and encourage users to report any suspected security vulnerabilities promptly.

## Supported Versions

Only the latest minor version will receive security updates. All older minor versions should be considered unmaintained.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

To report security vulnerabilities, please do NOT use our issues page. Instead, kindly email us at mobi@childmind.org. Please refrain from using other communication channels.

For non-security-related issues, we welcome your input and feedback on our issues page. Feel free to share your ideas and suggestions to help us improve our services.
