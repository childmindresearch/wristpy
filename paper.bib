            Wrist worn raw-data accelerometers are used increasingly in large-scale population research. We examined whether sleep parameters can be estimated from these data in the absence of sleep diaries. Our heuristic algorithm uses the variance in estimated z-axis angle and makes basic assumptions about sleep interruptions. Detected sleep period time window (SPT-window) was compared against sleep diary in 3752 participants (range = 60–82 years) and polysomnography in sleep clinic patients (N = 28) and in healthy good sleepers (N = 22). The SPT-window derived from the algorithm was 10.9 and 2.9 minutes longer compared with sleep diary in men and women, respectively. Mean C-statistic to detect the SPT-window compared to polysomnography was 0.86 and 0.83 in clinic-based and healthy sleepers, respectively. We demonstrated the accuracy of our algorithm to detect the SPT-window. The value of this algorithm lies in studies such as UK Biobank where a sleep diary was not used.},

	abstract = {Wearable acceleration sensors are increasingly used for the assessment of free-living physical activity. Acceleration sensor calibration is a potential source of error. This study aims to describe and evaluate an autocalibration method to minimize calibration error using segments within the free-living records (no extra experiments needed). The autocalibration method entailed the extraction of nonmovement periods in the data, for which the measured vector magnitude should ideally be the gravitational acceleration (1 g); this property was used to derive calibration correction factors using an iterative closest-point fitting process. The reduction in calibration error was evaluated in data from four cohorts: UK ( n = 921), Kuwait ( n = 120), Cameroon ( n = 311), and Brazil ( n = 200). Our method significantly reduced calibration error in all cohorts ( P {\textless} 0.01), ranging from 16.6 to 3.0 m g in the Kuwaiti cohort to 76.7 to 8.0 m g error in the Brazil cohort. Utilizing temperature sensor data resulted in a small nonsignificant additional improvement ( P {\textgreater} 0.05). Temperature correction coefficients were highest for the z-axis, e.g., 19.6-m g offset per 5°C. Further, application of the autocalibration method had a significant impact on typical metrics used for describing human physical activity, e.g., in Brazil average wrist acceleration was 0.2 to 51\% lower than uncalibrated values depending on metric selection ( P {\textless} 0.01). The autocalibration method as presented helps reduce the calibration error in wearable acceleration sensor data and improves comparability of physical activity measures across study locations. Temperature ultization seems essential when temperature deviates substantially from the average temperature in the record but not for multiday summary measures.},

	abstract = {Background
              : Physical behavior researchers using motion sensors often use acceleration summaries to visualize, clean, and interpret data. Such output is dependent on device specifications (e.g., dynamic range, sampling rate) and/or are proprietary, which invalidate cross-study comparison of findings when using different devices. This limits flexibility in selecting devices to measure physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep.
              Purpose
              : Develop an open-source, universal acceleration summary metric that accounts for discrepancies in raw data among research and consumer devices.
              Methods
              : We used signal processing techniques to generate a Monitor-Independent Movement Summary unit (MIMS-unit) optimized to capture normal human motion. Methodological steps included raw signal harmonization to eliminate inter-device variability (e.g., dynamic g-range, sampling rate), bandpass filtering (0.2–5.0 Hz) to eliminate non-human movement, and signal aggregation to reduce data to simplify visualization and summarization. We examined the consistency of MIMS-units using orbital shaker testing on eight accelerometers with varying dynamic range (±2 to ±8 g) and sampling rates (20–100 Hz), and human data (N = 60) from an ActiGraph GT9X.
              Results
              : During shaker testing, MIMS-units yielded lower between-device coefficient of variations than proprietary ActiGraph and ENMO acceleration summaries. Unlike the widely used ActiGraph activity counts, MIMS-units were sensitive in detecting subtle wrist movements during sedentary behaviors.
              Conclusions
              : Open-source MIMS-units may provide a means to summarize high-resolution raw data in a device-independent manner, thereby increasing standardization of data cleaning and analytical procedures to estimate selected attributes of physical behavior across studies.},

            Digital clinical measures based on data collected by wearable devices have seen rapid growth in both clinical trials and healthcare. The widely-used measures based on wearables are epoch-based physical activity counts using accelerometer data. Even though activity counts have been the backbone of thousands of clinical and epidemiological studies, there are large variations of the algorithms that compute counts and their associated parameters—many of which have often been kept proprietary by device providers. This lack of transparency has hindered comparability between studies using different devices and limited their broader clinical applicability. ActiGraph devices have been the most-used wearable accelerometer devices for over two decades. Recognizing the importance of data transparency, interpretability and interoperability to both research and clinical use, we here describe the detailed counts algorithms of five generations of ActiGraph devices going back to the first AM7164 model, and publish the current counts algorithm in ActiGraph’s ActiLife and CentrePoint software as a standalone Python package for research use. We believe that this material will provide a useful resource for the research community, accelerate digital health science and facilitate clinical applications of wearable accelerometry.},

              Background
              Accelerometery is commonly used to estimate physical activity, sleep, and sedentary behavior. In free-living conditions, periods of device removal (non-wear) can lead to misclassification of behavior with consequences for research outcomes and clinical decision making. Common methods for non-wear detection are limited by data transformations (e.g., activity counts) or algorithm parameters such as minimum durations or absolute temperature thresholds that risk over- or under-estimating non-wear time. This study aimed to advance non-wear detection methods by integrating a ‘rate-of-change’ criterion for temperature into a combined temperature-acceleration algorithm.
            
            
              Methods
              Data were from 39 participants with neurodegenerative disease (36\% female; age: 45–83 years) who wore a tri-axial accelerometer (GENEActiv) on their wrist 24-h per day for 7-days as part of a multi-sensor protocol. The reference dataset was derived from visual inspection conducted by two expert analysts. Linear regression was used to establish temperature rate-of-change as a criterion for non-wear detection. A classification and regression tree (CART) decision tree classifier determined optimal parameters separately for non-wear start and end detection. Classifiers were trained using data from 15 participants (38.5\%). Outputs from the CART analysis were supplemented based on edge cases and published parameters.
            
            
              Results
              The dataset included 186 non-wear periods (85.5\% {\textless} 60 min). Temperature rate-of-change over the first five minutes of non-wear was − 0.40 ± 0.17 °C/minute and 0.36 ± 0.21 °C/minute for the first five minutes following device donning. Performance of the DETACH (DEvice Temperature and Accelerometer CHange) algorithm was improved compared to existing algorithms with recall of 0.942 (95\% CI 0.883 to 1.0), precision of 0.942 (95\% CI 0.844 to 1.0), F1-Score of 0.942 (95\% CI 0.880 to 1.0) and accuracy of 0.996 (0.994–1.000).
            
            
              Conclusion
              The DETACH algorithm accurately detected non-wear intervals as short as five minutes; improving non-wear classification relative to current interval-based methods. Using temperature rate-of-change combined with acceleration results in a robust algorithm appropriate for use across different temperature ranges and settings. The ability to detect short non-wear periods is particularly relevant to free-living scenarios where brief but frequent removals occur, and for clinical application where misclassification of behavior may have important implications for healthcare decision-making.},

Significant research efforts have focused on wearable algorithm design and deployment in both research and clinical settings; however, open-source, general-purpose software tools for processing various activities of daily living are relatively scarce.

In this work, we introduce SciKit Digital Health (SKDH), a Python software package (Python Software Foundation) containing various algorithms for deriving clinical features of gait, sit to stand, physical activity, and sleep, wrapped in an easily extensible framework. SKDH combines data ingestion, preprocessing, and data analysis methods geared toward modern data science workflows and streamlines the generation of digital endpoints in “good practice” environments by combining all the necessary data processing steps in a single pipeline. Our package simplifies the construction of new data processing pipelines and promotes reproducibility by following a convention over configuration approach, standardizing most settings on physiologically reasonable defaults in healthy adult populations or those with mild impairment. SKDH is open source, as well as free to use and extend under a permissive Massachusetts Institute of Technology license, and is available from GitHub (PfizerRD/scikit-digital-health), the Python Package Index, and the conda-forge channel of Anaconda.},

              Design
              A bi-moving-window-based approach was used to combine acceleration and skin temperature data to identify wear and non-wear time events in triaxial accelerometer data that monitor physical activity.
            
            
              Setting
              Local residents in Swansea, Wales, UK.
            
            
              Participants
              50 participants aged under 16 years (n=23) and over 17 years (n=27) were recruited in two phases: phase 1: design of the wear/non-wear algorithm (n=20) and phase 2: validation of the algorithm (n=30).
            
            
              Methods
              Participants wore a triaxial accelerometer (GeneActiv) against the skin surface on the wrist (adults) or ankle (children). Participants kept a diary to record the timings of wear and non-wear and were asked to ensure that events of wear/non-wear last for a minimum of 15 min.
            
            
              Results
              The overall sensitivity of the proposed method was 0.94 (95\% CI 0.90 to 0.98) and specificity 0.91 (95\% CI 0.88 to 0.94). It performed equally well for children compared with adults, and females compared with males. Using surface skin temperature data in combination with acceleration data significantly improved the classification of wear/non-wear time when compared with methods that used acceleration data only (p{\textless}0.01).
            
            
              Conclusions
              Using either accelerometer seismic information or temperature information alone is prone to considerable error. Combining both sources of data can give accurate estimates of non-wear periods thus giving better classification of sedentary behaviour. This method can be used in population studies of physical activity in free-living environments.},
